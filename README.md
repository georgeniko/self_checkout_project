# database_project
Database project based on SQL with model and queries 

The core concept is a self-checkout system that can be installed in various stores and allows the customers to scan the products on their own and complete their purchases without the help of a cashier. The objective of the system is faster customer service and lower cost for businesses. 

The database contains all the necessary data so that the described system can operate.  Specifically, the entities are: Cart, Customer, Discount Code, Product, Terminal, Store Clerk, Store and Maintenance Engineer. These entities are connected with specific relations, as depicted in the file "db_model.png", which is a screenshot of the model of the database. The expected users of the database are: the administrator, the maintenance engineer, the shop employee and obviously, the customer. 

Files included:

- DBdump.sql, the full sql script for the creation of the database
- db_model.png, a screenshot of the model of the database
- model.mwb, the database model in MySQLWorkbench format
- queries.sql: SQL query script that showcases the functionality of the database.  
- users.sql: SQL script for the typical user creation as needed for the course. 

This database is part of a 3-person project developed on MySQLWorkbench for course "Databases" of Electrical & Computer Engineering (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki) for educational purposes. The members of the legendary Team 36: Daniilidou Iliana, Konstantinidis Konstantinos and George Nikolis.
